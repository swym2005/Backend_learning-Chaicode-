--> So in the web development projects the first thing that is discussed is,
    the backend.

--> For the backend we use a PRD which is known as the Product Requirement
    document which has information about the scopes of the backend.

--> In order to initialise the node for your backend you do 
        npm init in your command line.

--> Thats it, it creates a package.json saying stuff that you entered 
    in the command line while it initialised.

--> In this we are adding prettier to the node directory.

--> we know that there should be common syntax so prettier helps in that
    in order to use it you have to run two commands from their website.

--> Also you can set your own rules for the syntax and shit by making
    .prettierrc file and making rules in it. 

--> Also there is .prettierignore file which will ignore the files
    mentioned in it to be syntax perfect.
